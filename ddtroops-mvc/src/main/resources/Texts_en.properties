#ResourceBundle for English
# This file is intentionally empty, all English texts are inherited from the default language file.
#
# This file is needed because of the rules for finding localised texts defined in the JSTL specification.
# If this file does not exist, the system locale is used before the default language resource bundle,
# so for an English request to a server running in Czech system locale, JSTL would return Czech instead of default language.navigation.auth.login=Login
